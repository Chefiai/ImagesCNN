# Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to perform image recognition tasks. The CNN architecture is built using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python. The model is constructed by stacking convolutional layers, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. The dataset used for training and evaluation is structured into classes, each representing a distinct category of images. The training process involves feeding the CNN with labeled images, optimizing its weights through backpropagation, and fine-tuning to improve its ability to recognize various patterns and features within the images. The accuracy and loss metrics are monitored during training to assess the model's performance. Once trained, the model is capable of making predictions on new, unseen images, showcasing its ability to identify and classify objects or patterns within the image dataset. This repository aims to provide an easy-to-understand implementation of a CNN for image recognition, serving as a foundation for further exploration and experimentation in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
